Improvements to the sql:
1. Make sure to index all the columns in each table that is use in search and filter.
2. If possible, use '=' instead of 'LIKE'. Because '=' compares the whole string and 'LIKE' compares character by character which can be a little slower.
3. We can cache the result before do the query to avoid multiple joinings for each rows.
